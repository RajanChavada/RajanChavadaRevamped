# How I Use AI as a Developer

Everyone wants to use AI to code faster. But there's a difference between **rapid development** and **vibe coding** – generating random code without understanding what you're building.

## The Problem with Vibe Coding

When I first started using ChatGPT for coding, I'd paste a prompt, get a response, and ship it. No review. No understanding. That worked... until it didn't.

Here's what I learned:

### 1. Context Engineering Matters

Instead of asking:
> "Write me a React component for a todo list"

I ask:
> "Write a React component that manages a todo list with Redux, uses TypeScript, follows this pattern [pattern], and validates input with Zod. Here's the existing codebase structure: [context]"

The better your prompt, the better the output.

### 2. Validate Before Shipping

**Always** read the generated code:
- Does it match your codebase style?
- Are there edge cases it missed?
- Does it have security issues?

### 3. Use Specialized Tools

- **Claude**: Better at architectural decisions and complex reasoning
- **Copilot**: Fast for in-IDE completions
- **Cursor**: Built-in AI with full codebase context

## My Actual Workflow

1. **Specification Phase**: Write a detailed spec of what I want
2. **Generation Phase**: Use Claude or Cursor with full context
3. **Review Phase**: Read every line; don't just copy-paste
4. **Testing Phase**: Write tests to validate behavior
5. **Iteration Phase**: Refine based on real usage

Here's an example of AI-assisted code I actually use:

```python
def parse_transaction(data: dict) -> Transaction:
    """
    AI-assisted function:
    - Defined spec first
    - Generated with Claude
    - Validated with edge case tests
    """
    return Transaction(
        id=data['id'],
        amount=Decimal(str(data['amount'])),
        timestamp=datetime.fromisoformat(data['ts'])
    )
```

## The Result

By treating AI as a **co-worker, not a magic box**, I've cut development time by ~30% while improving code quality.

The key: **context engineering > prompt engineering > blind copy-paste**.

## Key Takeaways

1. AI tools are powerful, but they require thoughtful integration
2. Always review and understand generated code before shipping
3. Provide comprehensive context for better outputs
4. Use the right tool for the right task
5. Test everything, regardless of how confident the AI seems
