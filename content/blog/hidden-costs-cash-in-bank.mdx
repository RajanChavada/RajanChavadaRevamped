# The Hidden Costs of Leaving Cash Sitting in Your Bank

As a 20-year-old student living on campus, I have to juggle tuition, rent, and everyday expenses. But no matter how much I try to save, I realized something crucial: **my money shouldn't just sit there**.

## The Silent Killer: Inflation

Every dollar in your savings account is losing purchasing power every single day. While your bank might offer a 0.01% interest rate, inflation is running at 3-5% annually.

Here's the math:

| Year | $10,000 at 0.01% | Real Value (3% Inflation) |
|------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 0    | $10,000          | $10,000                   |
| 1    | $10,001          | $9,700                    |
| 5    | $10,005          | $8,587                    |
| 10   | $10,010          | $7,374                    |

That's **nearly $3,000 lost** over 10 years just from inflation.

## What I Did About It

### 1. High-Yield Savings Accounts

I moved my emergency fund to a high-yield savings account offering 4-5% APY. Same FDIC insurance, dramatically better returns.

### 2. Index Fund Investing

For money I don't need for 5+ years, I started investing in low-cost index funds. The S&P 500 has historically returned ~10% annually.

### 3. I-Bonds for Inflation Protection

Treasury I-Bonds adjust their rate based on inflation, protecting your purchasing power.

## The Student's Dilemma

I know what you're thinking: "I'm a student. I don't have money to invest."

But here's the thing – **you don't need a lot to start**:

- Many brokerages have $0 minimums
- Fractional shares let you buy partial stocks
- $50/month invested starting at 20 can grow to $500,000+ by retirement

## Action Steps

1. **Audit your accounts**: Where is your money sitting?
2. **Calculate your real returns**: Interest rate minus inflation
3. **Open a high-yield savings account**: Takes 10 minutes
4. **Start small with investing**: Even $25/month matters

The cost of inaction is real. Your future self will thank you for starting now.
